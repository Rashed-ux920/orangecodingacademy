    <h1>What is the introduction of math?</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new cojectures, and estavlish truth by rigorous deduction from appropiately chosen axioms and definitions.
        <br>
        There is debate over whether mathematical obhects such as mumbers and points exest nathrally or are human creation, The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce called mathematics " <u>the science that  draws necnssary conclusions"</u> <mark> Albert <br> 
        Einstein,</mark> on the other hand, stated that " <u>as for as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are certain, they do not refer to reality </u> " </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural sciene,engineering, medicine, and the social sciences, Appllied mathematics, </u>
        the branch of mathematics concerned with appllication <br>
        for its own sake, without having any appllication in mind, although practical appllication for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

   <h1> <u>Introductiion to chemistry</u></h1>
    <h4>
        <mark>chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other, you study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you,Everything yoou touch of taste or smell is a <br>
        chemical, and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. <mark><u>chemistry forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.</u></mark> From thestructure of proteins and uncleic acids, synthesis and <br>
        manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you <br>
        <br>
        <del>The principles of chemical are quite varied and are essentially important wich includes brain funetioning, computer operations, weather patterns, ehemieal inlldustries, manufaturing fertilizers, acids, alkalis, salts, drugs, soaps,ete.</del><br>
        chemistry also acts as a major determint in meeting th human needs for food healthcare  products, and also other <mark>materials</mark> are aimed at improving the life's quallity.
